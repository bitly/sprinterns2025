# Event.ly React Frontend

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool.

## Prerequisites 

Ensure you have node installed:

```bash
node -v
```

If node isn't found, from the project root directory:

```bash
brew install node
```

## Available Scripts

To get the front end running, you can run:

```bash
cd views/js/evently
npm install
npm start
```

or use the dev command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner (Vitest) in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Locally preview the production build.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
